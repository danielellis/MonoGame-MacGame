#MonoDevelop MonoGame Template for MacOS
I had a bit of trouble finding a functional template for MonoGame on the Mac. I also found the steps for getting it to work from scratch to be difficult for somebody new to the platform. I added this repository to help anybody else out who's trying to get started.

## Instructions

1. Install all prerequesites listed [here](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/wiki/Tutorials%3AInstalling-Prerequisites-on-MacOS-for-MonoMac-project)
2. Clone this project
3. Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to check out the MonoGame code.
4. Open MacGame.sln in MonoDevelop
5. Start it up!

Feedback welcome. Please open issues if you run into more problems or feel something is otherwise incomplete.
