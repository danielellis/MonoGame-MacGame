#MonoDevelop MonoGame Template for MacOS
I had a bit of trouble finding a functional template for MonoGame on the Mac. I also found the steps for getting it to work from scratch to be difficult for somebody new to the platform. I added this repository to help anybody else out who's trying to get started.

## Instructions

1. Install all prerequesites listed [here](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/wiki/Tutorials%3AInstalling-Prerequisites-on-MacOS-for-MonoMac-project)
2. Fork or copy the contents of this project
3. Open MacGame.sln in MonoDevelop
4. Fix references to the MonoGame and Lidgren projects
5. Start it up!

Feedback welcome. Please open issues if you run into more problems or feel something is otherwise incomplete.
